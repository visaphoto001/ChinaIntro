                <h3>Writing System</h3>
                <p>The Chinese writing system is one of the oldest continuously used writing systems in the world. Chinese characters (汉字) are logograms, with each character representing a syllable and a meaning. The system has evolved over thousands of years, from oracle bone inscriptions to the simplified characters used today in mainland China. Calligraphy, the art of writing characters beautifully, is highly valued in Chinese culture. The complexity and beauty of Chinese characters have influenced other East Asian writing systems, including Japanese kanji and Korean hanja.</p>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>Character Evolution - From oracle bones to modern script</li>
                    <li>Simplified vs. Traditional - Regional variations</li>
                    <li>Calligraphy - The art of beautiful writing</li>
                    <li>Influence on Other Languages - Japanese and Korean writing</li>

                <h3>Spoken Chinese</h3>
                <p>Chinese is not a single language but a family of languages, with Mandarin (普通话) being the official language of China. Other major varieties include Cantonese (粤语), spoken in Guangdong and Hong Kong; Hokkien (闽南语), common in Fujian and Taiwan; and Hakka (客家话), used by the Hakka people. These varieties are often mutually unintelligible but share the same writing system. Mandarin has four tones that change the meaning of words, making pronunciation challenging for learners. Pinyin, the romanization system for Chinese characters, helps foreigners learn pronunciation.</p>

                <h3>Literature</h3>
                <p>Chinese literature has a rich history spanning thousands of years. Classical Chinese poetry, particularly from the Tang Dynasty, is celebrated for its brevity and imagery. The Four Great Classical Novels—Journey to the West, Water Margin, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Dream of the Red Chamber—are masterpieces that have influenced literature throughout East Asia. Modern Chinese literature has produced Nobel laureates like Mo Yan and explores themes of tradition, change, and identity in contemporary China.</p>
