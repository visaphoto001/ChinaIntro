                <h3>Natural Resources</h3>
                <p>China is rich in natural resources, which have played a crucial role in its development. The country is the world's largest producer of rare earth elements, essential for modern technology. Its vast coal reserves have fueled industrial growth, though with environmental consequences. China's agricultural regions produce rice, wheat, and tea, while its forests provide timber and medicinal plants. The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River is the world's largest hydroelectric power station, symbolizing China's efforts to harness its natural resources.</p>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>Minerals - Coal, iron ore, and rare earth elements</li>

                <h3>Climate Zones</h3>
                <p>China's vast size and diverse topography create a wide range of climate zones. The north experiences harsh winters and hot summers, with a continental climate. The south has a subtropical climate with high humidity and abundant rainfall. The Tibetan Plateau has an alpine climate with cold temperatures year-round. The northwest has an arid climate with little rainfall. These climate variations influence agriculture, architecture, and daily life across different regions of China.</p>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>North - Continental climate with four seasons</li>

                <h3>Environmental Challenges</h3>
                <p>China faces significant environmental challenges as it continues to develop economically. Air pollution in major cities has been a serious health concern, though recent efforts have improved air quality. Water scarcity and pollution affect many regions, particularly in the north. Desertification is spreading in some areas, while deforestation has reduced forest cover. The government has implemented various environmental policies, including ambitious renewable energy targets and reforestation programs, to address these challenges.</p>
