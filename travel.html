                <h3>Essential Information</h3>
                <p>Traveling to China requires some preparation to ensure a smooth experience. Most visitors need a visa, which should be obtained before arrival. The best times to visit are spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November), when weather is mild. Major cities have extensive public transportation systems, including high-speed trains connecting urban centers. While English is spoken in tourist areas, learning basic Chinese phrases can enhance your experience. Internet access requires a VPN in most cases, and payment is increasingly digital through platforms like WeChat Pay and Alipay.</p>

                <h3>Must-Visit Destinations</h3>
                <p>China offers countless destinations that showcase its rich history and diverse landscapes. The Great Wall, particularly the sections near Beijing, is a must-see for any visitor. The Terracotta Army in Xi'an, discovered in 1974, is one of the most significant archaeological finds of the 20th century. The karst landscapes of Guilin and Yangshuo feature dramatic limestone peaks and scenic river cruises. Shanghai's Bund and Pudong districts contrast historic architecture with futuristic skyscrapers. For nature lovers, the Yellow Mountains (Huangshan) offer stunning vistas of granite peaks and ancient pine trees.</p>

                <h3>Cultural Etiquette</h3>
                <p>Understanding Chinese cultural etiquette can help visitors navigate social situations respectfully. Greetings often involve a slight nod or handshake rather than hugs or kisses. When dining, it's polite to try all dishes offered and to leave some food on your plate to show you've had enough. Gift-giving is common, but avoid giving clocks (associated with death) or white flowers (used at funerals). Respect for elders is important, and using appropriate titles shows politeness. When visiting temples or homes, removing shoes is often expected. Understanding these customs can help create positive interactions with locals.</p>
