                <h3>Cooking Techniques</h3>
                <p>Chinese cooking techniques are diverse and have been refined over thousands of years. Stir-frying (炒) is perhaps the most well-known method, allowing for quick cooking that preserves nutrients and flavors. Steaming (蒸) is used for delicate foods like dim sum and fish. Braising (炖) and stewing (煮) are used for tougher cuts of meat and for creating rich, flavorful broths. Deep-frying (炸) creates crispy textures, while roasting (烤) and grilling (烧烤) add smoky flavors. These techniques are often combined in complex dishes that balance flavors, textures, and colors.</p>

                    <li>Stir-frying - Quick cooking over high heat</li>
